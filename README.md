# Nyxi Showcase

This repository contains **public documentation and sanitized outputs** for **Nyxi** — a *proprietary* execution-time governance system for irreversible actions.

- ✅ What you’ll find here: writeups, diagrams, evidence semantics, demo outputs, and reproducible *public* artifacts.
- ❌ What you will NOT find here: Nyxi source code or implementation details.

## One-sentence definition
Nyxi enforces execution-time authority at a single irreversible boundary: **proposals** may come from humans or models, but only **authorized** actions can commit irreversible effects.

## Key idea (observable property)
**VETO ⇒ irreversible sink unchanged**  
**ALLOW ⇒ irreversible sink changes**

## Start here
- `docs/PRODUCT.md` — what Nyxi is / is not
- `docs/EVIDENCE.md` — how to read outputs (authorization vs execution outcomes)
- `outputs/` — sanitized demo runs / reports
